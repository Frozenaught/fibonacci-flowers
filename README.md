# fibonacci-flowers

A simple HTML5 canvas application

This project was originally inspired by a tutorial on youtube form [Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymmtEgp0Tuc&list=PLYElE_rzEw_v8TXJ_ITSSBP_ypUKfQ7K-&index=1)

I added a simple GUI to generate some random fibonacci flowers, you can take a look at the result [here on GitHub Pages](https://frozenaught.github.io/fibonacci-flowers/)
